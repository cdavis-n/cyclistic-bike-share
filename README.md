# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis

## 1. Introduction 
This is a case study for the Google Data Analyst Certification on Coursera. 
In this case study, I worked for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. 

### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. 
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand 
**_how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently_**.
From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

### 1.2 About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments.
* ##### Pricing Plans & Memberships
  There are 3 types of plans: Single-ride passes, Full-day passes, and Annual memberships.
  * Member = Annual memberships
  * Casual = Single-ride passes or/and Full-day passes

## 2. Problems
Cyclistic wants to increase the profit. Cyclistic’s nance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
the director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Business Task: **_Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members_**

In order to do it, I needed to better understand:
  * How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
  * Why casual riders would buy Cyclistic annual memberships
  * How Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members


## 3. Process 
### 3.1 Data Collection
In this case study, 2 kinds of public data are used. The Range of the time is from March 2024 to February 2025.
  * Cyclistic users' trip data from DIVVY
  * Weather data from visualcrossing

### 3.2 Data Cleaning 
In order to clean the data, I used Excel to clean data and BigQuery to combine data. In Excel, the data which have errors were fixed as much as possible, such as station names. Due to the CSV feature, I assume when the data converted to CSV, the decimal numbers of latitude and longitude are rounded up somehow which causes the error to define station name. Some stations' rounded up numbers are unique; therefore, I can define the station name. However, most stations are close to each other. It is impossible to define the station name from rounded latitude and longitude. The huge problem is I cannot remove all the data which latitude and longitude are 2 decimal points due to the amount of data with the error. It would be affecting the data analysis. Thus, I removed station name from the data set.
