# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis

## Introduction 
This is a case study for the Google Data Analyst Certification on Coursera. 
In this case study, I worked for a fctional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. 
In order to answer the business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act.

### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. 
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to
understand **_how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently_**.
From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

### About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown
to a eet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments.
* ##### Pricing Plans & Memberships
  There are 3 types of plans: Single-ride passes, Full-day passes, and Annual memberships.
  * Member = Annual memberships
  * Casual = Single-ride passes or/and Full-day passes

## Problems
Cyclistic wants to increase the profit. Cyclistic’s nance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more protable
than casual riders. Although the pricing exibility helps Cyclistic aaract more customers,
the director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Business Task: **_Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members_**

In order to do it, I needed to better undersrtand:
  * How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
  * Why casual riders would buy Cyclistic annual memberships
  * How Cyclistic can use digital media to inuence casual riders to become members
